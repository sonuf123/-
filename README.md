## Problem Statement

As part of the T20 World Cup Cricket project, we aim to analyze data from the 2022 tournament to assemble the best possible cricket team representing Earth, capable of competing against alien opponents. This project involves web scraping data from ESPN Cricinfo, performing data cleaning and transformation using Python and pandas, and building insightful dashboards in Power BI. Our objective is to identify the top 11 players based on their performance metrics, ensuring that they can collectively score at least 180 runs on average and have the capability to defend effectively.

### Steps followed 

- Load Data into Power BI Desktop: Begin by importing the dataset, which is provided as a CSV file, into Power BI Desktop.

- Open Power Query Editor: Access the Power Query Editor and enable options like "column distribution," "column quality," and "column profile" under the View tab in the Data preview section.

- Configure Column Profiling: Since the default profile displays data for only 1000 rows, ensure to select "column profiling based on the entire dataset" to have a comprehensive view.

- Identify Data Anomalies: Investigate the dataset for errors and empty values. Address any issues observed, ensuring data integrity.

- Handle Null Values: Address null values, if any, particularly in critical columns. Decide whether to exclude null values based on their significance to the analysis.

- Apply Themes: Enhance the visual appeal of the report by selecting an appropriate theme under the View tab in the report view.

- Add Visualizations: Utilize various visualization options available in Power BI to represent different aspects of the data effectively.

- Implement Visual Filters (Slicers): Enhance interactivity by adding visual filters such as slicers for key fields, enabling users to dynamically explore the data.

- Create Card Visuals: Incorporate card visuals to display essential metrics such as average departure delay and average arrival delay. Apply visual-level filters to refine data representation, excluding null values if necessary.

- Design Bar Charts: Create bar charts to visualize categorical data, such as customer satisfaction ratings segregated by gender, ensuring clear representation of insights.

Utilize Ratings Visual: Leverage the Ratings Visual to depict various aspects of customer feedback, providing insights into areas like baggage handling, check-in services, cleanliness, etc.

By following these steps, users can effectively leverage Power BI to analyze T20 World Cup Cricket data and assemble the best possible team for the hypothetical scenario of competing against alien opponents.
