## Dataset Sources
The Zomato Dashboard project utilizes multiple datasets related to food, restaurants, menus, orders, and users. These datasets provide essential information for analyzing and visualizing restaurant-related data.

Food Dataset: Contains details about various food items available at restaurants.
Restaurant Dataset: Includes information about different restaurants such as name, location, cuisine, ratings, etc.
Menu Dataset: Provides menu items offered by restaurants.
Orders Dataset: Stores data related to customer orders.
Users Dataset: Contains user information including demographics, preferences, etc.

## Data Extraction using Zomato API
API Utilization for Data Extraction
The Zomato API is leveraged to extract restaurant-related data for analysis and visualization. The following steps outline the process of extracting data using the Zomato API:

API Authentication: Obtain API key from Zomato Developer portal.
Data Retrieval: Use API endpoints to fetch restaurant, menu, and order data.
Data Transformation: Convert API responses into structured datasets suitable for analysis.

## Power BI Dashboard Creation
The final step involves integrating the processed datasets with Power BI to create dynamic and interactive dashboards for analyzing Zomato-related data. This includes data modeling, visualization design, and dashboard publishing.

## Key Power BI Functionalities Utilized
1. #### Data Modeling: 
- Established relationships between datasets (e.g., one-to-many relationships between restaurants and orders).
2. #### Visualization Design:
 Created various visualizations (e.g., bar charts, maps, slicers) to represent data insights effectively.

3. #### Dashboard Interactivity:
 - Implemented interactive features (e.g., filters, drill-throughs) to enable users to explore data dynamically.
4. #### Dashboard Design Best Practices

#### Data Cleansing: 
Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
#### Drill-Down Analysis:
 Enabling users to dive deeper into specific data points for detailed analysis.
#### AI-Powered Visuals:
 Explored advanced visualization techniques including AI integration for predictive analytics.
